Quotes App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to inspire and motivate users through a collection of meaningful quotes. The app displays quotes organized into different categories such as motivation, life, love, and success, making it easy for users to find quotes that match their mood.
Users can mark quotes as favorites, rate them, and access their saved quotes offline using local storage. The app also supports light and dark themes for a better user experience. Firebase is integrated for backend services, while Hive is used for fast and reliable offline data storage.
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of modern Flutter concepts including state management, local database integration, and clean app architecture.
